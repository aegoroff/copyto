**copyto** is a small command line app written in Go that allows you to easily one way
sync files between source folder and target folder. i.e. all files from source that
matches (by relative path) corresponding files in target folder will be copied from source folder to
target one.

The app supports setting source and target paths directly from command line and configuration file
in TOML format also can be used. Using configuration file you can setup several sources and targets.

Also you can setup file names filter using include or exclude options (or both) using either configuration
file or command line. Include filter allows only file matched to be copied. Exclude filter allows all files but
those that matched to be copied.

## Install the pre-compiled binary

**homebrew** (only on macOS and Linux for now):

Add my tap (do it once):

```sh
brew tap aegoroff/tap
```

And then install copyto:

```sh
brew install copyto
```

Update copyto if already installed:

```sh
brew upgrade copyto
```

**scoop**:

```sh
scoop bucket add aegoroff https://github.com/aegoroff/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install copyto
```

**AUR (Arch Linux User Repository)**:

install binary package:

```sh
 yay -S copyto-go-bin
```

or if yay reports that package not found force updating repo info

```sh
yay -Syyu copyto-go-bin
```

**manually**:

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/aegoroff/copyto/releases) and
copy to the desired location.

## Examples:

Let's do one way sync files between folder _D:\fSource_ and _D:\fTarget_. Source folder content:

```
sub
  |- f3.pub
f1.docx
f2.pptx
f4.rar
```

Target folder content:

```
sub
  |- f3.pub
f1.docx
f2.pptx
f5.xlsx
```

So we use command line to run syncing:

```
copyto cmdline -s D:\fSource -t D:\fTarget
```

It will copy 3 files from _D:\fSource_ to _D:\fTarget_ and says that _f5.xlsx_ not found in the source folder.
File _f4.rar_ will not be copied because it is not exists in the target folder:

```
   Found files that present in target but missing in source:
     \f5.xlsx

   Total copied:                              3
   Copy errors:                               0
   Present in target but not found in source: 1
```

Now let's do the same task using config file. Create text file in UTF-8 encoding with the content like this:

```
# Example copyto config

title = "Exaample sync"

[sources]
 [sources.src1]
  source = 'D:\fSource'

[definitions]

  [definitions.def1]
  sourcelink = "src1"
  target = 'D:\fTarget'

  [definitions.def2]
  source = 'D:\fSource1'
  target = 'D:\fTarget2'
```

**IMPORTANT:** So as not to write double back slashes on Windows use string in '(apos) instead of "(quote).

**IMPORTANT:** All keys must be in lower case

You can use one source for several definitions using it's key (string after dot in square brackets) as value
of _sourceLink_ option. If both _source_ and _sourceLink_ defined in the
same definition _source_ option wins.

And then use it using config verb:

```
copyto config -p D:\example.toml
```

The app will do sync and shows output like this:

```
 Section: def1
 Source: D:\fSource
 Target: D:\fTarget
   Found files that present in target but missing in source:
     \f5.xlsx

   Total copied:                              3
   Copy errors:                               0
   Present in target but not found in source: 1

 Section: def2
 Source: D:\fSource1
 Target: D:\fTarget2

   Total copied:                              0
   Copy errors:                               0
   Present in target but not found in source: 0
```

Filtering config example:

```
# Example copyto config

title = "Exaample sync"

[sources]
 [sources.src1]
  source = 'D:\fSource'

[definitions]

  [definitions.def1]
  sourcelink = "src1"
  target = 'D:\fTarget'
  exclude = '*.exe'

  [definitions.def2]
  source = 'D:\fSource1'
  target = 'D:\fTarget2'
  include = '*.txt'

  [definitions.def3]
  source = 'D:\fSource3'
  target = 'D:\fTarget4'
  include = '*.txt'
  exclude = 'bad*.txt'
```
